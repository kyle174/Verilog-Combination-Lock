The combination lock is a digital system that functions through a predefined 4-bit input code, operating as a finite state machine. Users can input a 4-bit value, which the system validates against either a default or user-defined combination.  Successful validation grants the user access, while an incorrect input triggers an alarm until the system is reset.
